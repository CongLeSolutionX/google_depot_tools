I think this is already safe to merge, as the script that it calls doesn\u0027t exist yet.\n\nMy test:\n```\n# patch this CL into my depot_tools\n$ gn gen --args\u003d\"is_debug\u003dtrue use_remoteexec\u003dtrue\" out/debug\n$ autoninja -C out/debug base  # this should use ninja+reclient\n# patch crrev.com/c/5901413 into my chromium\n$ autoninja -C out/debug base  # this should still use ninja+reclient\n$ gn clean out/debug\n$ autoninja -C out/debug base  # this should use siso+reclient now\n```\n\nI also tested GN args with explicit use_siso\u003dtrue and use_siso\u003dfalse, and they also both work as expected.",
