      "message": "Sorry, forgot something.  For automatically editing the user\u0027s config, that can be somewhat invasive.  It\u0027s pretty standard to set a custom Git config option that indicates that it has already run and doesn\u0027t need to be run again, rather than a file.\n\nThat way, removing the file doesn\u0027t re-clobber the user\u0027s global config.  And the user can manually add a `win_bootstrap \u003d skip` option to manually skip this.\n\nI think this is used in various places in depot_tools/luci.  If you find my auth CLs in depot_tools, you can see how I did that, with an incrementing version number to re-run bootstrap if any updates were made.  (I\u0027ll link it later if I don\u0027t forget).\n\nEven if you don\u0027t do the above, I recommend adding your comment as a comment for context.",

With that, I think we should ask user for permission to set it up, and maybe even hard fail fetch/gclient operation if postprocess_path is not set.",
